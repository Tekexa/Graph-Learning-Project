# Graph Learning Project

This repository contains the code I used to answer the questions from my Graph Learning Project, a homework under the supervision of Pr. [Vincent Gauthier](https://github.com/vgauthier).
The tasks were asked [here](https://github.com/Tekexa/Graph-Learning-Project/blob/main/Homework_Network_Analysis-1.pdf), and answered (in french) [here](https://github.com/Tekexa/Graph-Learning-Project/blob/main/rapport/NetSci_GraphLearning_Piatte.pdf)
