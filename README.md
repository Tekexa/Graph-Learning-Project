# Graph Learning Project

This repository contains the code I used to answer the questions from my Graph Learning Project, a homework under the supervision of  [Pr.Gauthier](https://github.com/vgauthier).

The tasks were asked [here](https://github.com/Tekexa/Graph-Learning-Project/blob/main/Homework_Network_Analysis-1.pdf), and answered (in french) [here](https://github.com/Tekexa/Graph-Learning-Project/blob/main/rapport/NetSci_GraphLearning_Piatte.pdf). My production in this homework includes all Python scripts and notebooks present in this repository, although they are vastly retrieved from following the class of Pr. Gauthier and the lab work he provided [here](https://github.com/ComplexNetTSP/ComplexNetTD).
